### installation

start with " npm install " to install necessary packages that are used in the project

### starting the app

after the installations are completed, you can use " npm start " to view the working application

### projects structure

i used views/components structure, views contain the general structures and functions of pages, and components hold the
small parts of the app as much as possible
translation was done with the help of i18next and some small setup
